    description: `Professor Sandi directs the Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics at EPFL's Brain Mind Institute. Her research focuses on three main areas: The neurobiological mechanisms involved in the formation of social hierarchies and their modulation by stress and anxiety. The mechanisms through which early-life stress promotes the risk of psychopathologies, with a main focus on the emergence of pathological aggression. The mechanisms linking altered neuroplasticity during development and pathological aggression. Professor Sandi was the director of the Brain and Mind Institute for 7 years and is the current President of the European Federation of Neuroscience Societies.`,

In 1985, Professor Swaab founded the Netherlands Brain Bank, which supplies the international research community with clinical and neuropathological brain tissue. Swaab is Emeritus Professor at the University of Amsterdam and Professor at Zhejiang University, Hang Zhou, China since 2007.
    His major research interest focusses on brain development, sexual differentiation, Alzheimer’s disease, the neurobiological basis of depression and eating disorders.`,

    name: 'Baldomero (Toto) Olivera',
    avatar: '/baldomero.png',
    description: `Dr. Olivera is a Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Utah as well as HHMI Professor (2006 – Present). Dr. Olivera obtained his B.S. in University of the Philippines and his Ph.D. California Institute of Technology. 
    Baldomero Olivera initiated the characterization of predatory cone snail venoms. His research focuses on the individual molecular components present in cone snail venoms, which are mostly relatively small, highly structured peptides (“conopeptides as conotoxins”). Olivera’s Chemistry to Biodiversity project engages elementary school students in hands-on experimental science that encourages them to explore local biodiversity and cultural traditions through a module called From Chemistry to Biodiversity and provides students with undergraduate mentors. He is adapting the module to be used in diverse educational settings in the U.S. and the Philippines.

    description: `Dr. Grinevich is currenly the Chair of the  Department of Neuropeptide Research for Psychiatry, Central Institute of Mental Health (CIMH-ZI), Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University. His research is focused on the exploration of the functional connectivity of hypothalamic neurons and manipulation of  axonal neuropeptide release within the rodent forebrain by viral, optogenetic,  pharmacogenetic, electrophysiological, behavioral and fMRI means. Besides, his group evaluates the role of select genes in hypothalamic neurons controlling stress response, metabolism and reproduction.`,

    description: `Dr. Diego Bohorquez is a principal investigator of the Duke University, School of Medicine. His research focuses on the connections between two seemingly isolated systems: the gut and the brain. Dr. Bohorquez’ work has opened up, using modern neuroanatomical techniques in vivo, the neuronal connections between these two major organs that allow their precise communication in feeding, satiety, and monitoring and regulation of nutrient onboarding in mammals.`,
