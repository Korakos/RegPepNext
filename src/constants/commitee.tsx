Eiden is the Chief of the Section on Molecular Neuroscience in the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. He received his B.A. in Chemistry from Northwestern University in Evanston Illinois, and Ph.D. in Pharmacology from The University of Kansas, and was a Staff Fellow, PRAT Fellow, and Senior Staff Fellow in the NIMH Intramural Research Program before joining the faculty as a Principal Investigator and Chief of the Unit on Cell Biology in 1987, and Chief of the Section on Molecular Neuroscience in 1992. His work at the NIH has focused on stimulus-secretion-synthesis coupling, characterization of the vesicular and secretory proteins mediating chemically coded neurotransmission, including chromogranin A, VMAT1, VMAT2, and VAChT and signaling pathways underlying neuropeptide-mediated stress responses. More recently, the laboratory has been involved in microarray- and bioinformatics-aided gene discovery within neuropeptide-dependent stress-activated cellular signaling pathways in the central nervous system, and has characterized a novel cAMP sensor for neuroendocrine cell-specific GPCR-initiated signaling to the MAP kinase ERK.

During the past decade he has held faculty positions at the Scripps Research Institute and Stanford University, where he has characterized the role of hypocretins in various mammalian behaviors. Recently, his lab has applied optogenetic techniques to directly modulate neurons that produce hypocretins and other neuromodulators to elucidate their role in behaviors, especially sleep/wake maintenance, stress, and reward.'

Professor Leng is a leading expert in neuroendocrinology, with over 250 published papers, covering diverse aspects of the regulation of vasopressin, oxytocin, growth hormone and appetite regulation. He is a former Editor-in-Chief of the ‘Journal of Neuroendocrinolgoy’, and between 2012 to 2016 was President of the International Neuroendocrine Federation. Although first trained as a mathematician, he is best known for his experimental studies on neuroendocrine systems, but his recent work has increasingly involved computational modelling. He has a strong active commitment to the public understanding of science. Dr. Leng has over many years devised rigorous and imaginative experiments aimed at a fundamental understanding of how homeostatic demands are translated into changes in neurosecretory cell electrical activity leading to secretion.

      'Professor Robert P. Millar is Director of the Centre for Neuroendocrinology at the University of Pretoria, Senior Research  Fellow at UCT, Research Fellow at the Centre of Integrative Physiology at the University of Edinburgh and Professor emeritus at the university of St Andrews. Previously he was Director of the MRC Human Reproductive Sciences Unit in Edinburgh which comprised over 100 researchers. He secured over 70 million pounds research funding during his tenure.  The Unit research focused on pathologies of female and male reproductive tissues (eg prostate, breast and ovarian cancers). He was founder of the reproductive health company, Ardana Biosciences which raised 73 million pounds, was listed on the LSE, and took three drugs into the market. Dr. Millar has published >400 papers which received >20,000 citations, and filed 18 patents. Bob’s research focuses on peptide regulators of reproductive hormones. He pioneered the discovery of the GnRH prohormone, novel GnRH structures, and the first cloning of the GnRH I and GnRH II receptors. His laboratory delineated GnRH binding sites and the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor activation and coupling. He has participated in, and led, a number of programs developing GnRH analogues for use in a wide range of clinical pathologies. His group’s research on direct antiproliferative effects of selective GnRH analogues on tumour cells has revealed the novel concept of ligand-induced-selective-signalling by GnRH analogues which has implications for improved selectivity in the development of new GnRH therapeutics and other GPCR targets. His research encompasses a continuum of basic through to clinical and he has been involved in taking ten neuropeptides and analogues into humans. Recently he has focused on novel upstream GPCRs regulating GnRH, kisspeptin and neurokinin B. He developed kisspeptin and NKB antagonists as potential therapeutics in hormone-dependent diseases. The functional ‘rescue’ of human GPCRs with inactivating mutations by small molecules is a new interest.'
